            <dd>In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that
                provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.
                <br><br>
                Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where
                everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.
                <br><br>
                Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.
                <br><br>
                The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.

            <dd>As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in
                programming, they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code. Objects
                are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks assigned by you. Object-oriented programming aims to
                implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim
                of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the
                code can access this data except that function. It simplifies
                software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:<br>

                        <dd class="ddconcept">Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example,
                            a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.
                            <br><br>
                            An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes
                            up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's
                            data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of
                            response returned by the objects.
                            <br><br>
                            Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as
                            behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.

                            one type. Using classes, you can create multiple objects with the same behavior instead of
                            writing their code multiple times. This includes classes for objects occurring more than
                            once in your code.</dd>

                        <dd class="ddconcept">Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). It
                            is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and
                            methods) of another class. In Java, inheritance means creating new classes based on existing
                            ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that
                            class. In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well. </dd>

                        <dd class="ddconcept">The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can
                            define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

                            Real-life Illustration: Polymorphism
                            <br>
                            A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is
                            a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in
                            different situations. This is called polymorphism.
                            <br>
                            Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
                            Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words,
                            polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word
                            “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

                        <dd class="ddconcept">Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential
                            details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essential units are not displayed
                            to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.
                            <br><br>
                            Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required
                            characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviors
                            of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in
                            classifying/grouping the objects.
                            <br><br>
                            Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the
                            accelerators will increase the speed of a car or applying brakes will stop the car, but he
                            does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not
                            know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of the accelerator, brakes,
                            etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
                            <br><br>
                            In java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100%
                            abstraction using interfaces.
